<h1>Crystal Collector</h1>

This was my fourth homework assignment during the Northwestern Web Dev bootcamp.  The primary goals of this assignment were to demonstrate skills using jQuery, in addition to adding basic CSS styling.


<h2>To Play</h2>
This game operates somewhat like Blackjack.
<ul>
<li>The game chooses a number.  This is chosen at random using math.floor, and then is displayed on the screen.</li>
<li>The game then chooses random values for each of the crystals displayed on the page, again using math.floor.  You can then click on the crystals to try to tie with the randomly chosen number.  If you tie, you win.  Go over, you lose</li>

<h2>Style</h2>
Style was created to be a throwback to late 1990s/early 2000s web game styles. Gem images and background were pulled via google image search.  Fonts are from Google Fonts.
